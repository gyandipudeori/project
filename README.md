AlumniDonationDAO

Vision

The AlumniDonationDAO aims to create a decentralized platform for alumni to contribute to their alma mater or charitable causes associated with it. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures transparency, security, and democratic decision-making in the management and allocation of funds donated by alumni.

   How It Works

1.Alumni Registration:

-Only approved alumni can participate in the DAO.

-The contract owner has the authority to add or remove alumni.

2.Donations:

-Approved alumni can donate ETH to the DAO.

-All donations are pooled into the contractâ€™s balance.

3.Proposal Creation:

-Alumni can propose fund allocations, specifying the purpose, amount, and recipient.

-Each proposal is stored on the blockchain with details like description, amount, recipient, vote count, and execution status.

4.Voting:

-Alumni can vote on active proposals.

-Each alumnus can vote once per proposal.

-Proposals with a majority vote (more than 50% of alumni) are eligible for execution.

5.Execution:

-Once a proposal receives enough votes, it can be executed, transferring the requested amount to the recipient.
